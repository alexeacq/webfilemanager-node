In the next example we deploy a web file manager using node v22.12.0.
You can change the root directory inside server.js file, that is set up in /mnt/test by default.
Please, take into acount to run node server as a sudoer in order not to have any permission issues.
Once you run the server, you can try it using the next link:

  http://localhost:3000
  
Any suggestion will be well received.
